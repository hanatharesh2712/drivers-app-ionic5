  <p>This Agreement creates an independent contractor relationship, not an employment relationship between DRVN and the Partner. As such, the Partner agrees that this Agreement is not a contract of employment and is not evidence of an employment relationship. As an independent contractor of DRVN, the Partner is not required to purchase or rent any products, equipment, or services from DRVN as a condition of entering into this Agreement.

The Partner is solely responsible for all taxes applicable to themselves, including, but not limited to, income and social security taxes. DRVN will not withhold taxes from fees paid to the Partner, including taxes for unemployment insurance or workers' compensation benefits.

The Partner will be solely responsible for any obligations or liabilities to Passengers or third parties that arise from the provision of a Ride. The Partner is free to provide chauffeured ground transportation service to other businesses and third parties outside of any specific time period during which the Partner provides Rides for DRVN.</p>
  <h1><strong>3. Representations, Warranties, &amp; Covenants</strong></h1>
  <p>The Partner represents and warrants to DRVN that the Partner holds all legal capacity and authority to enter into and perform the Partner&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement.

Throughout the term of this Agreement, the Partner will provide DRVN with any forms, documents, or certifications as may be required for DRVN to verify representations and warranties the Partner has made in this Agreement or the Partner&rsquo;s compliance with any provision of this Agreement.</p>
  <h2><strong>3.1 Verification of Insurance</strong></h2>
  <p>The Partner must secure full liability insurance coverage for the vehicle(s) used to provide Rides. DRVN must be named as an Additional Insured under the Partner's insurance policy. Partner agrees to provide DRVN with a copy of a current certificate of insurance immediately upon obtaining and procuring such insurance (and upon renewal), together with proof that DRVN is named as an Additional Insured.</p>
  <h2><strong>3.2 Non-Solicitation &amp; Non-Circumvention</strong></h2>
  <p>The Partner recognizes that DRVN has a legitimate business interest in protecting its relationships with its Passengers and other independent contractors. Therefore, the Partner warrants, represent, and agrees to that during the term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year following the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Partner, employees, and/or Drivers, will not, directly or indirectly; (a) contact, deal with or otherwise become involved with any Passengers introduced, directly or indirectly, by or through DRVN, its officers, directors, agents or associates, for the purpose of providing chauffeured ground transportation services to Passengers; (b) solicit any persons or entity who provided Rides on behalf of DRVN during the term of this Agreement to perform chauffeured ground transportation services for or on behalf of the Partner, without the specific written approval of DRVN.</p>
  <h2><strong>3.3 Non-Discrimination &amp; Distribution of Ride Offers</strong></h2>
  <p>DRVN proposes Ride Offers to the Partner solely based on availability, without regard to race, sex, color, national origin, sexual orientation, religion, gender identification, disability, age, or geographic departure point or destination. DRVN, at its sole discretion, may send Ride Offers to any Partner as it deems appropriate. At times, DRVN may send a Ride Offer to multiple Partners, pending the acceptance or rejection of the Ride Offer. DRVN does not make any guarantee in regards to the frequency or a particular quantity of Ride Offers.</p>
  <h1><strong>4. Scope of Service</strong></h1>
  <p>DRVN proposes Ride Offers to the Partner via (a) the App; (b) the Portal; (c) email communication sent to the Partner from DRVN. The Ride Offer features Ride details including, but not limited to, pick-up time, pick-up date, pick-up location, drop-off location, special requests, and vehicle type. The Partner will have the option to accept or reject the Ride Offer. At times, DRVN may modify the Ride details and will immediately notify the Partner via email of any such modifications. The Partner agrees to carefully review all Ride details as DRVN will not be held responsible for the Partners misinterpretation of Ride details resulting in failure to successfully accomplish a Ride. Ride delays or cancellations by the Partner must be reasonably communicated with DRVN via phone call and speaking with a DRVN agent. If the Partner is unable to perform the Ride or has not arrived at the pick-up location at the designated pick-up time, DRVN reserves the right to replace the Partner and not award payment.</p>
  <h1><strong>5. Compensation</strong></h1>
  <p>DRVN agrees to compensate the Partner a Fee for each Ride successfully completed. A Ride is deemed successfully completed when the Partner picks-up the Passenger and drops-off the Passenger at the arranged destination. The Fee to the Partner for the successful completion of a Ride is calculated based on a &ldquo;Rate&rdquo;; composed of a proprietary algorithm executed by DRVN. The Partner acknowledges and agrees to comply with the Fee posted by DRVN for each Ride, unless, DRVN and the Partner agree in writing to a specific Fee amount. The Rate shall be proportionally adjusted if any modifications are made to the Ride Offer and/or Ride.</p>
  <h2><strong>5.1 Reimbursement of Expenses</strong></h2>
  <p>DRVN shall reimburse the Partner for expenses incurred such as parking, toll charges, and waiting time reasonably incurred. Any expenses the Partner incurs shall be logged and reported by the Partner within forty-eight (48) hours after the completion of the Ride. Failure from the Partner to report expenses via (a) the App, (b) a Partner created invoice, or (c) email response from the Partner, will result in the non-reimbursement of such expenses.</p>
  <h2><strong>5.2 Ride Settlement and Payment Execution</strong></h2>
  <p>Payment to the Partner is based on a Trip Total per Ride. The Trip Total is made up of a Fee and expenses. Payment to the Partner will be performed on a bi-weekly basis via an electronic bank transfer to the Partners&rsquo; desired bank account, unless, DRVN and the Partner agree in writing to a specific payment schedule. If the Partner fails to inform DRVN of any deemed or alleged incorrect Trip Totals within five (5) business days after receiving payment, the Trip Total shall be deemed correct. DRVN reserves the right to withhold and/or adjust the payment due to: (a) a Partner&rsquo;s breach of obligations of this Agreement; (b) an investigation in relation to the Partner&rsquo;s improper performance of a Ride; (c) losses or damages arising from the improper performance of a Ride; (d) an investigation in relation to the Partner&rsquo;s improper reporting of Expenses.</p>

  <p>DRVN licenses the right to use the App, pursuant to a license agreement (&ldquo;License Agreement&rdquo;) with its affiliate Moveo Technologies Corp. (dba drvn) (&ldquo;Licensor&rdquo;). The Partner is hereby granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the App to receive, manage Ride Offers, and accomplish Rides, provided: (a) the partner uses the App solely for the purposes expressly authorized by this Agreement and for no other purpose, and (b) Partner shall not take any action which shall or could result in DRVN being in violation of any term or condition of the License Agreement or this Agreement. Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Partner&rsquo;s right and license to use the App shall without notice to Partner immediately terminate and Partner shall not have any further rights to use the App. DRVN may, in its sole discretion, also discontinue the Partner&rsquo;s use of the App at any time shall believe that Partner&rsquo;s use of the App may cause DRVN harm or may violate this Agreement.</p>
  <h2><strong>6.1 Company Data</strong></h2>

Neither this Agreement nor the Partner&rsquo;s use of the App or Company Data conveys or grants the Partner any rights: (a) in or related to the App or Company Data, except for the limited non-exclusive non-transferable license granted above; or (b) to use or reference in any manner DRVN&rsquo;s, Licensor&rsquo;s or DRVN&rsquo;s respective affiliates&rsquo; company names, logos, product and service names, trademarks, services marks or other indicia of ownership, except as necessary to perform Rides in accordance with this Agreement.</p>

  <h1><strong>9. Indemnification and Hold Harmless</strong></h1>
  <p>The Partner agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless DRVN and its affiliates and successors, and each of their respective directors, officers, and employees (each an "Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from any third-party allegation or claim based on, or any loss, damage, settlement, cost, expense, and any other liability (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) arising out of or in connection with, (a) the Partner&rsquo;s negligence, strict liability, or misconduct, (b) a breach of this Agreement by the Partner, (c) any action or inaction by the Partner (including any and all loss or damage to personal property or bodily harm (including death) relating to or arising out of any such action or inaction), or (d) any allegation or claim that the Partner failed to comply with applicable laws, rules, or regulations.
